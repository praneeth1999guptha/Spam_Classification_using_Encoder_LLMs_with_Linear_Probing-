# Spam_Classification_using_Encoder_LLMs_with_Linear_Probing-
we will use encoder Large Language Models (LLMs) for spam classification. We will leverage the rich features of pre-trained LLMs without fine-tuning them. Instead, we will freeze the LLM weights and train a lightweight classifier head (MLP) on top for spam classification.
